## Simple Summary
As $MUSIC has proved its concept in the past two years, the community has proned to move the token to #Ethereum to make it more sustainable. 

## Motivation
The proliferation of #Ethereum has proved itself a more sustainable platform to nurture some nonfungible tokens and related projects, if $MUSIC 2.0 is built upon such a ecosystem, it would be much more sustainable to musicians and creators, as well as to music appreciators. 


## Rationale
1. Downsize the yield of MUSIC chain, to a level of ~zero
2. Introduce the new token of $MUSIC (2.0) on Ethereum to integrate with the upper level of applications (mobile+web)

## Specification
- After block 6.3M: We deploy step 1
- Before the hardfork block, we will wire apps with new token and make sure a smooth transition

## Backwards Compatibility
- We will find a solution to convert $MUSIC v1.0 to $MUSIC v2.0, neverthess, it may take some time

## Implementation

- GMC
- Parity spec and customized version
