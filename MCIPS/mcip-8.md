## Simple Summary
It's time to move to a new consensus to make the blockchain more sustainable. 

## Abstract
How to make sure the blockchain is really serving everyone equally and make sure it's inclusive enough on distributing value, transferring value and evergreen. 

Proof-of-Sharism(PoSh) is a long-envisioned direction for $MUSIC even before all those perils in the industry. We should start the journey and prove it's the future. 

## Motivation
The supply of Bitcoin tantalized a lot of people to make them believe that the economy of blockchain comes from a limited supply. However, a limited supply only makes the market fluctuate much simply because it makes the cryptocurrency not useful. We don't want to be abducted into the same peril, it's why we should really make the blockchain useful and meaningful to carry values instead of being the value itself. So to speak, the real value of the usages of a blockchain is possible to be much bigger than the blockchain value itself. 

On the other hand, we don't think the current industry has a valid solution, either PoW, PoS, or PoA(Proof-of-Authority) are not compatible with the vision of usages in the real world, but only make the riches richer and eventually could be disastrous.  it's why we should share our ideas and make it workable.
